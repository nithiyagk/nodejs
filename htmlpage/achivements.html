<h1>ACHIVEMENTS OF KING OF POP</h1>
<br>

<h2>1. Eight Grammy Awards in 2 hours:<br></h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
The 1980s was a golden decade for Mr. Jackson. There’s a long list of his achievements in that era but the most popular happened to be during the Grammy Awards Ceremony on 28th Feb 1984 where Michael won 8 awards majorly for the “Thriller” album. His pairing with Quincy Jones has always resulted in wonders. At such a young age, when he was just 25 years old, he was a threat to many senior artists of that time.

<h2>2. Artist of the Century:</h2>
<blockquote>
Not for a year or a decade but MJ has been known by us as the “Artist of the Century”. The world knew it that from the very beginning that the baby Michael who used to sing and dance with his brothers will leave the world speechless with his legacy but on 9th January 2002, the world saw him receiving the American Music Award for being the Artist of the Century and that is when we had a quick flashback over the unforgettable achievements of MJ throughout his career.</blockquote>

4. Received twice in Rock & Roll Hall of Fame:
</h2>
<blockquote>
We can observe Michael Jackson’s name in the list of Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees not only once but twice. In 1997, the Jacksons were inducted and in 2001, Michael being a solo artist was again inducted and according to him, it was an honor and a great pleasure to be blessed with this achievement again after 4 years. At the occasion, Michael stated that he owes Barry Gordy so much for his success. He also thanked Quincy Jones, Diana Ross and other close friends for the support.

<h2>5. Super Bowl 27 Performance:
</h2>
<blockquote>
Michael Jackson was an initiative person and one of the examples of this trait of MJ is his Live performance in Super Bowl on 31st January 1993 and enlisted his name on the top of a list of the solo artists who performed during the halftime of Super Bowl. Michael sang his best songs including “Billie Jean”,”Jam”,”Heal the World” and “Black or White”. Since then, the ratings for the Super Bowl halftime got increased.
</blockquote>
<h2>6. Best selling artist of all time:
</h2>
<blockquote>
After The Beatles on the top and Elvis Presley on the 2nd position, Michael Jackson is the top 3rd artist among the best selling artists of all time with an active period of 45 years having maximum sales of 350 million (minimum 300 million). Jackson’s first solo single “Got to be there” was released in 1971 and became his first charted record. Whether in the group or as a solo artist, Michael has always been awesome and special.

<h2>7. Grammy Living Legend Award:

<blockquote>
What’s more special than taking an award from your own sister’s hand? The King of Pop took this honor at a pleasant night of 24th February 1993 while receiving the Grammy Living Legend Award from Janet Jackson. MJ became one of the 15 artists that have received this precious award. The world has known him as one of the biggest influencers of the music industry whose legacy is unbeatable and he himself is immortal. 
</blockquote>
<h2>8. Jackson 5’s Four debut singles on the chart: 
</h2>
<blockquote>
Michael Jackson being a preteen, became the reason for the four singles of Jackson 5 to be on the Billboard chart. “I want you back”,”ABC”,”I’ll be There” and “ The Love You Save” are the songs that lead the Jackson brothers to the peaks of success and it was majorly because of the melodious voice of the young Michael that captured the hearts of the people when he used to perform with a smile on his face.
